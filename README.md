# Grey Boxes

No black boxes (NBB). This repository contains "grey boxes" (GBs) of fundamental modern technologies in modern neuroscience research.
Each GB is a stand-alone set of tools, documentation, and tutorials that attempt to de-obfusicate its content.

The basic tools (hardware, software, documentation) used to open these black boxes are contained in the "white box" sub-folder.

## Getting Started
